# Parrot Refactoring Kata
This was [taken from Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache/Parrot-Refactoring-Kata). I have also completed this in Swift, [over here](https://github.com/acodeguy/parrotRefactoringKata).

## Original Specification
Can you spot any code smells in this code? I'll give you a clue - a spot of Pol(l)ymorphism should improve matters!

Refactor this code, take small steps, run the tests often. See how small and beautiful you can make it.

## Approach
After reading through the code, I could see that the Parrot class could be split into sub-classes as not all types of parrot used all parts of the code.
